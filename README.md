# telephone-number-generator
Telephone number generator, Web page that generates numbers of cell phones randomly from USA and Colombia.

added functions and multiple validations in the algorithm so that the generated numbers are as close as possible to a number 100% real, reliable, existing and assigned to an operator from USA and Colombia. 

next I will integrate google-libphonenumber to add another extra filter when generating numbers. 
If you want to verify that the number of assets can call them, to save time I recommend multiple payment apis that do it in a massive way, and can be integrated into this code. 

in the code there are multiple comments that explain how it works and why many things in the code and functions but only are in SPANISH those comments.
